I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Vietnam in Apr. 2009. I got my Master of Engineering degree in Electronic and Computer Engineering from RMIT University, Australia in Nov. 2013. I finished my Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Ulsan, South Korea in Aug. 2020. I was a postdoctoral researcher with the Department of Electrical, Electronic, and Computer Engineering, University of Ulsan, South Korea, from Sept. 2020 to Feb. 2021. Starting from Mar. 2021, I work as a postpoctoral research fellow at the Artificial Intelligence Research Center, Pusan National University, South Korea.  

## Research Interests

My research interest is on artificial intelligence (i.e., deep learning and deep reinforcement learning techniques) with applications to wireless communication networks. I am currently working on the following categories: energy harvesting,  radio resource management, cognitive radio, mobile edge computing (MEC), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS).
